\arguments{
\item{data_long}{Data frame or list of data frames each corresponding to a landmark age \code{x_L} (each element of the list must be named the value of \code{x_L} it corresponds to).
Each data frame contains repeat measurements data and time-to-event data in long format.}

\item{x_L}{Numeric specifying the landmark time(s)}

\item{x_hor}{Numeric specifying the horizon time(s)}

\item{covariates}{Vector of character strings specifying the column names in \code{data_long}
which correspond to the covariates}

\item{covariates_time}{Vector of character strings specifying the column names in \code{data_long}
which contain the times at which \code{covariates} were recorded. This should either be length 1 or
the same length as \code{covariates}. In the latter case the order of elements must correspond to the
order of elements in \code{covariates}.}

\item{k}{Integer specifying the number of folds for cross-validation. An alternative to setting parameter \code{cross_validation_df} for performing cross-validation;
if both are missing no cross-validation is used.}

\item{cross_validation_df}{List of data frames containing the cross-validation fold each individual is assigned to. Each data frame in the list should be
named according to the landmark time \code{x_L} that they correspond. Each data frame should contain the columns \code{individual_id} and a column \code{cross_validation_number}
which contains the cross-validation fold of the individual. An alternative to setting parameter \code{k} for performing cross-validation;
if both are missing no cross-validation is used.}

\item{individual_id}{Character string specifying the column name in \code{data_long} which contains the individual identifiers}

\item{event_time}{Character string specifying the column name in \code{data_long}
which contains the event time}

\item{event_status}{Character string specifying the column name in \code{data_long}
which contains the event status (where 0=censoring, 1=event of interest, if there are competing events these are labelled
2 or above).}

\item{survival_submodel}{Character string specifying which survival submodel to
use. Three options: the standard Cox model i.e. no competing risks (\code{"standard_cox"}),
the cause-specific regression model (\code{"cause_specific"}), or the Fine Gray
regression model (\code{"fine_gray"})}

\item{b}{Integer specifying the number of bootstrap samples to take when calcluating standard error of c-index and Brier score}
}
\value{
List containing containing information about the landmark model at each of the landmark times.
Each element of this list is named the corresponding landmark time, and is itself a list containing elements:
\code{data}, \code{model_longitudinal}, \code{model_survival}, and \code{prediction_error}.

\code{data}  has one row for each individual in the risk set at \code{x_L} and
contains the value of the \code{covariates} at the landmark time \code{x_L} using the LOCF approach. It also includes the predicted
probability that the event of interest has occurred by time \code{x_hor}, labelled as \code{"event_prediction"}.
There is one row for each individual.

\code{model_longitudinal} indicates that the longitudinal approach is LOCF.

\code{model_survival} contains the outputs from the function used to fit the survival submodel, including the estimated parameters of the model.
For a model using cross-validation, \code{model_survival} contains a list of outputs with each
element in the list corresponding to a different cross-validation fold. For more information on how the survival model is fitted
please see \code{?fit_survival_model} which is a function used within \code{fit_LOCF_landmark}.

\code{prediction_error} contains a list indicating the c-index and Brier score at time \code{x_hor} and their standard errors if parameter \code{b} is used.
For more information on how the prediction error is calculated
please see \code{?get_model_assessment} which is the function used to do this within \code{fit_LOCF_landmark}.

\description{
This function performs the two-stage landmarking analysis. In the first stage, the longitudinal submodel is fitted using the LOCF method and in the
second stage the survival submodel is fitted.
}
\details{
Firstly, this function selects the individuals in the risk set at the landmark time \code{x_L}.
Specifically, the individuals in the risk set are those that have entered the study before the landmark age
(there is at least one observation for each of the \code{covariates} on or before \code{x_L}) and
exited the study on after the landmark age (\code{event_time}
is greater than \code{x_L}).

Secondly, if the option to use cross validation
is selected (using either parameter \code{k} or \code{cross_validation_df}), then an extra column \code{cross_validation_number} is added with the
cross-validation folds. If parameter \code{k} is used, then the function \code{add_cv_number}
randomly assigns these folds. For more details on this function see \code{?add_cv_number}.
If the parameter \code{cross_validation_df} is used, then the folds specified in this data frame are added.
If cross-validation is not selected then the landmark model is
fit to the entire group of individuals in the risk set (this is both the training and test dataset).

Thirdly, the landmark model is then fit to each of the training data. There are two parts to fitting the landmark model: using the longitudinal data and using the survival data.
Using the longitudinal data is the first stage and is performed using \code{fit_LOCF_longitudinal}. See \code{?fit_LOCF_longitudinal} more for information about this function.
Using the survival data is the second stage and is performed using \code{fit_survival_model}. See \code{?fit_survival_model} more for information about this function.

Fourthly, the performance of the model is then assessed on the set of predictions
from the entire set of individuals in the risk set by calculating Brier score and C-index.
This is performed using \code{get_model_assessment}. See \code{?get_model_assessment} more for information about this function.
